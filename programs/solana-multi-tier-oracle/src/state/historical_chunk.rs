/// High-performance circular buffer for historical price data storage.
/// 
/// # Architecture Design Rationale
/// 
/// This struct implements a circular buffer using fixed-size arrays to provide O(1) insertion
/// and retrieval of historical price data while working within Solana's account size constraints.
/// Key design decisions:
/// 
/// - **Zero-Copy Performance**: Direct memory access eliminates serialization overhead during
///   frequent price updates, critical for maintaining low latency in high-frequency scenarios
/// - **Circular Buffer Pattern**: Prevents expensive array shifts when the buffer is full,
///   maintaining constant-time insertion regardless of historical depth
/// - **Fixed Account Size**: Predictable storage costs enable accurate rent exemption calculations
///   and prevent account size growth from causing transaction failures
/// - **Linked List Architecture**: Chain of chunks enables unbounded historical storage while
///   respecting individual account size limits (â‰¤10MB on Solana)
/// 
/// # Memory Layout Optimization
/// 
/// Fields are ordered to minimize memory overhead and optimize cache performance:
/// - Metadata fields grouped together for sequential access during buffer management
/// - Large price_points array placed after metadata to avoid fragmentation
/// - Buffer size chosen as power-of-2 to enable efficient modulo operations via bitmasking
/// 
/// # Trade-offs
/// 
/// - **Space vs Time**: Fixed allocation wastes space when partially filled but eliminates
///   reallocation overhead and provides predictable performance characteristics
/// - **Complexity vs Performance**: Circular buffer logic is more complex than simple append
///   but provides superior performance for the historical data access patterns

/// 
/// # Design Philosophy
/// 
/// This struct balances storage efficiency with analytical utility for historical price data.
/// Unlike real-time price feeds that prioritize update frequency, historical data emphasizes:
/// 
/// - **Analytical Completeness**: Volume data enables sophisticated manipulation detection
///   and market microstructure analysis over time
/// - **Storage Efficiency**: Compact representation minimizes account storage costs for
///   large historical datasets spanning months or years
/// - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Explicit padding ensures consistent layout across
///   different architectures and compiler versions
/// 
/// # Field Selection Rationale
/// 
/// Each field serves specific analytical or operational purposes:
/// - Price + confidence + expo: Core price representation matching industry standards
/// - Timestamp: Enables temporal analysis and time-weighted calculations
/// - Volume: Critical for detecting manipulation patterns and market health metrics
/// - Padding: Prevents subtle alignment bugs that could corrupt historical data

    /// This implementation prioritizes constant-time insertion over memory efficiency:
    /// 
    /// 1. **Direct Assignment**: Overwrites the slot at head position without shifting elements
    /// 2. **Bitwise Modulo**: Uses `& (BUFFER_SIZE - 1)` instead of `% BUFFER_SIZE` for
    ///    faster wraparound calculation (requires BUFFER_SIZE to be power-of-2)
    /// 3. **Conditional Tail Update**: Only advances tail when buffer is full, maintaining
    ///    FIFO ordering while preserving all data during initial fill phase
    /// 
    /// # Performance Characteristics
    /// 
    /// - Time Complexity: O(1) regardless of buffer state or historical depth
    /// - Space Complexity: O(1) with no dynamic allocation
    /// - Cache Efficiency: Sequential head advancement optimizes memory access patterns
    ///
