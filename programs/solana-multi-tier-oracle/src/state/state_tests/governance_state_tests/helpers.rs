// Test helpers for governance_state unit tests.
//
// Notes on intent:
// - These helpers create deterministic, zero-surprise fixtures meant for
//   reasoning about security invariants. Fixtures must be reproducible so
//   fuzzing, property tests, and auditors can replicate failing scenarios.
// - The helpers deliberately use fixed-size arrays and zero-copy patterns to
//   mirror on-chain constraints (no Vec, stable layout, explicit padding).
// - Where we construct raw bytes or reconstruct structs from bytes we do so to
//   emulate the memory layout of on-chain accounts and validate ABI/serialization
//   assumptions.

/// Default number of allowed DEX programs populated in fixtures.

/// truncation and capacity-related invariants without needing a full-capacity
/// array. Keeps test data lightweight while still validating boundary
/// behaviours.
