//! Deterministic, invariant-driven unit tests for `GovernanceState` primitives.
//!
//! Why these tests exist
//! - Governance primitives encode on-chain authority and must resist a wide
//!   range of accidental and adversarial behaviors. These tests express the
//!   security properties (invariants) we expect the public API to maintain.
//!
//! Focus and scope
//! - Tests operate at the public API surface rather than implementation
//!   internals, mirroring how external callers (and attackers) will interact
//!   with the program. This keeps the tests robust to internal refactors while
//!   preserving security guarantees.
//! - We validate three core themes:
//!   1. Membership invariants: active member count must be enforceable and
//!      reductions must revoke privileges.
//!   2. Permission invariants: bitwise permission operations must be additive,
//!      reversible, and constrained to a canonical mask to avoid accidental
//!      privilege escalation via unknown bits.
//!   3. Layout and ABI invariants: zero-copy and reserved padding must remain
//!      stable after state mutations so on-chain serialization never surprises
//!      downstream programs.
//!
//! Design trade-offs called out by the tests
//! - Zero-copy patterns and stack-allocated buffers reduce compute and heap
//!   pressure on-chain but require strict layout and padding checks â€” hence the
//!   dedicated padding/zeroing tests.
//! - Permission bits are represented as a compact bitfield for efficiency;
//!   tests focus on ensuring bit-twiddling doesn't introduce unknown bits or
//!   destroy unrelated permissions.
