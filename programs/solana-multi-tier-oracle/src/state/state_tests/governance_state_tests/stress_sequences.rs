//! Stress testing for governance state operations under concurrent-like conditions.
//!
//! These tests simulate real-world scenarios where governance operations occur
//! in rapid succession, such as during incident response, key rotations, or
//! emergency protocol updates. In DeFi protocols, governance failures can result
//! in catastrophic financial losses, making these stress patterns critical for
//! ensuring system reliability.
//!
//! # Why Stress Testing Matters
//!
//! Governance systems in blockchain protocols must handle:
//! - **Emergency Response**: Rapid permission changes during security incidents
//! - **Key Rotations**: Frequent member additions/removals for security hygiene
//! - **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple governance actions happening simultaneously
//! - **State Consistency**: Ensuring invariants hold across complex state transitions
//!
//! Traditional unit tests verify correctness under normal conditions, but stress
//! tests validate that the system remains secure and consistent under adversarial
//! or high-pressure scenarios where operators might make mistakes or act hastily.
//!
//! # Test Design Philosophy
//!
//! These tests use deterministic patterns (modulo arithmetic, fixed iteration counts)
//! to ensure reproducible results while exercising edge cases that could expose
//! race conditions or invariant violations in production systems. The patterns
//! mimic real operator behavior during crisis situations where decisions are made
//! quickly and under pressure.
