//! Boundary testing for governance timing parameters and multisig thresholds.
//!
//! These parameters control critical security boundaries in DeFi governance systems.
//! Timing parameters determine how long attackers have to respond to malicious proposals,
//! while thresholds define the consensus requirements for executing privileged operations.
//! Incorrect bounds or validation can lead to governance attacks, fund loss, or protocol
//! takeover scenarios.
//!
//! # Why Boundary Testing Matters
//!
//! Governance parameters in DeFi protocols are attack vectors because they:
//! - **Control Fund Access**: Thresholds determine how many signatures are needed for withdrawals
//! - **Enable Protocol Changes**: Timing parameters can be exploited during flash loan attacks
//! - **Create Race Conditions**: Improper bounds can cause integer overflows or underflows
//! - **Bypass Security Controls**: Edge cases might allow privilege escalation or DoS attacks
//!
//! These tests ensure that parameter validation prevents both obvious attacks and subtle
//! edge cases that could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries. The documented ranges
//! serve as a security specification that auditors can verify against implementation.
//!
//! # Parameter Security Implications
//!
//! - **Timing Parameters**: Control proposal lifecycles and execution delays. Must handle
//!   extreme values without causing integer overflow or creating exploitable timing windows.
//! - **Threshold Parameters**: Define consensus requirements using basis points (1/10000).
//!   Must prevent division by zero, ensure meaningful consensus, and handle edge cases.
//! - **Multisig Alignment**: Thresholds must remain valid when membership changes occur,
//!   preventing governance deadlock or unauthorized actions during membership transitions.
